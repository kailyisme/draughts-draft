            ## `Objectives`
            - To write a web app that implements different tech stacks
            - To develop an MVP for an app, in the time available, that proves we can learn and develop new technologies ourselves
            - To enhance our portfolios with a stand-out app
            - To have some additional features that can be added to the completed MVP to prove we are able to 'manage' the development of an app and not just 'write an app'
            ---
            ## `Anti-Goals`
            - An original app
            - A marketable app; the time is not available
            ---
            ## `The Game` - _Main Screen_
            ![draught](screen.svg)
            - 2 players play draughts agianst each other from their own computers
            - Initially, move the pieces by selecting the piece to be moved and then it's final location
            - Incorporate a chat screen
            - If time, add functionality to 'drag and drop' the pieces and animation
